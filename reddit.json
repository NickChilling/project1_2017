We know it <em>sounds</em> \"crazy\" to suggest that the \"DNC\" assassinated a leaker. It's a pretty extraordinary theory.

Keep in mind the political environment around the time of his death.

The stakes had never felt higher. </p>\n\n<p>Still, if it wasn't for the anomalies around the case, the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6d5l9v/seth_richs_family_demands_that_police_release/di04vaa/?\">Scott Foval tape</a> (where high level DNC operatives admit ON VIDEO that they use mentally ill, homeless folks, and union toughs to do their dirty work) and the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6di1yw/trump_blamed_by_msm_for_leaking_intel_to_russia/\">Deep State leaks</a> (that knowingly endanger our National Security and risk the lives of innocent people), I don't think I'd be able to accept the <em>possibility</em> that the DNC killed him. </p>\n\n<p>But those tapes and those leaks exist, and there are dozens of weird coincidences and red flags, including the behavior of <strong>Wikileaks' Julian Assange all but coming right out and stating that Seth was his source</strong> (<a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ihzn7k8663zy.png\">just one example here</a>, in addition to many other statements, e.g., announcing a reward for info re the killers) and the fact that <strong>Seth was murdered <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6cekp7/repost_i_solved_assanges_weird_poem_secretaries/\">just weeks after the date of the final leaked email, and just 4 days before the \"Russian Hacking\" claim went public</a>, and 5 days before so-called \"Guccifer 2\" went public</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Before you dismiss the theory as crazy consider that many of you have seriously entertained the theory that a former KGB agent is running the President of the United States as a straight up FSB asset, but you have trouble even CONSIDERING the mere possibility that Seth's murder might have been a political assassination? O_O</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our operating THEORY is that it's more likely to be a political assassination than a robbery-gone-wrong.</strong> We BELIEVE Seth was more than \"just\" an awesome patriot. We believe he was a hero who risked his life to expose corruption. And now he's dead, likely betrayed by people he once looked up to.</p>\n\n<p>We're not the only ones who want answers. <strong>The \"Profiling Project\", working with the Rich family for months and months, recently <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/31/group-sues-mayor-police-for-details-of-seth-rich-murder-investigation/\">sued the police, demanding that they release surveillance video footage, Medical Examiner\u2019s report, and the forensic ballistic report</a></strong>. In fact, ALL of the independent investigators who have worked with the family have denounced the \"failed robbery\" theory, and insist the D.C. police release more info. </p>\n\n<h1>Why do independent investigators and centipedes want the basic facts released? For obvious reasons, but we'll list a few. Consider the failed robbery theory in light of these questions:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How close was the shooter when he fired his weapon each time, and what does the ShotSpotter say about the timing between shots? Were there only two shots? </li>\n<li>Where <em>exactly</em> was he shot, and what does that tell us, if anything, about the experience of the shooter?</li>\n<li><strong>If the police showed up within ONE MINUTE of the shooting (as is claimed), how come no shell casings were found</strong>? Is it because the shooter used a revolver? What kind? If not a revolver, we're supposed to believe that the shooter was so unhinged that he lost his cool and murdered Seth without robbing him (shooting <em>at least</em> twice), didn't steal anything, but still had the presence of mind to find the shell casings?</li>\n<li>If not a revolver, what kind of weapon was it? <strong>Can we rule out a connection to the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6div0c/his_name_was_seth_rich_2_guns_and_2_boxes_of_040/\"> 2 guns and 2 boxes of 0.40 caliber ammunition stolen from an FBI vehicle 2 miles away from the murder site, just 2 hours before Seth Rich was murdered</a></strong>?</li>\n<li>What did Seth say when they arrived? The responding officer's body cameras were active. and Seth was conscious. First responders later said they were shocked he didn't survive, because he was so talkative. </li>\n<li>To what extent was their bruising, and where <em>exactly</em> was it (his \"hands\", sure.. but what about his knuckles)? If he has extensive bruising on his <em>knuckles</em> that would imply that there was a physical scuffle.</li>\n<li>What kind of watch was he wearing? The kind someone would bother stealing? The robbery angle relies significantly on a \"torn but not broken wristband.\" Do we know if it was torn during the struggle? There are <em>always</em> other explanations, but it'd be helpful to know if it was an Apple Watch, a Rolex, or a Casio.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Some oddities and coincidences we'd like the authorities to address:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why were the <strong>the manager and staff of the bar where Seth spent his last night <a href=\"http://mobile.wnd.com/2017/05/bar-manager-cops-never-talked-with-staff-about-night-seth-rich-died/\">never interviewed</a>?</strong> Why did the police never request surveillance footage from the bar? Did they request surveillance footage from the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/6cttkj/i_started_mapping_the_cctv_cameras_near_the_seth/\">many cameras on the most natural routes from the bar to his home</a>? Why won't they release any of it if they have?</li>\n<li>Why are we <strong>hearing reports from anonymous sources that police were told to stand down in their investigation</strong>? Obviously the police formally reject that claim, but who is looking at it to ensure that they're speaking truthfully?</li>\n<li>There is <strong>still an unnamed federal source who claims there is evidence of contact between Wikileaks and Seth</strong>. This has been forgotten because of initial unrelated problems with the article that published the claim. Why is no one looking into this now?</li>\n<li>Why were the <strong>FBI <a href=\"http://archive.is/4BlUX\">prevented</a> from investigating the DNC servers</strong>? What was the DNC afraid of them finding?</li>\n<li>Where is the skepticism around the many claims of \"Guccifer 2\", in the face of the many <a href=\"http://g-2.space/\">anomalies</a>? With nations hacking each other <em>constantly</em>, <strong>who is looking into the possibility that there was <em>both</em> a hack <em>and</em> an insider leak?</strong></li>\n<li>Who is looking into whether Seth Rich's identity was \"unmasked\" by the inappropriate spying that has been widely reported? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Please understand, we empathize with his family.</strong> We can only imagine what pain they are going through. But we also know that nearly every statement that reaches us comes through <strong>Rich 'family spokesman' Brad Bauman</strong>, a deeply partisan man who <strong>is <a href=\"http://i.magaimg.net/img/jl4.jpg\">affiliated with SEIU and DNC</a></strong> and <strong>was himself the <a href=\"http://i.magaimg.net/img/jlm.png\">Executive Director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus</a></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Does that sound like an impartial intermediary the world should accept at face value? How does he feel about the investigation? The statements that come 'through' him are pretty interesting. Apparently, the family is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/money/2017/05/19/media/russian-embassy-seth-rich-inaccurate-fox-news-story/index.html\">convinced</a> that claims about Seth's heroic leaking \"injure the memory and reputation of Seth Rich.\" But if he was exposing corruption, why would that be the case? Who is convincing them of that? Their handler also appears to be proactively <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/seth-rich-family-right-wing-media-report-wikileaks-2017-5\">ruling out ANY evidence</a> that might change their mind, releasing a statement \"<strong>Even if tomorrow an email [directly connecting Seth to Wikileaks] was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions</strong> as emails can be altered\".</p>\n\n<p>We want justice for them as much as we do for Seth, and I'd never want the police to do anything for our \"benefit\" that'd in any way jeopardize the investigation. But there is so, so much that could be released that couldn't possibly risk tipping off the criminal, since the criminal <em>knows</em> they know tons of things about ballistics, etc. So why are they kept hidden?</p>\n\n<p><strong>We want, answers, because we want Justice. But to get answers, we must keep his memory alive.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>JUSTICE FOR SETH RICH \ud83d\udc3c</h1>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Centipedes, I need your help</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I want to add a link to a summary video but it should be well-vetted and have zero mistakes or outdated information.** Any ideas?</li>\n<li>I could also use help adding info to this comment and identifying any mistakes. </li>\n<li>Can anyone recommend a sane article regarding the Awan Brothers and their possible connections?

Clapper and Brennan then decided they could obtain \"everyone's\" info through banks' systems \"vulnerabilities\". They asked Montgomery what he would need to create a strong and large enough system to crack bank passwords at like a billion per hour or whatever, a leap from the previous password-cracking computers. Montgomery figured it out, told them, they got the money and had Montgomery build The Hammer. Here's a recording describing Montgomery's skill being commandeered by Clapper and Brennan, the speaker is talking to Sheriff Joe Arpaio with hopes of getting whistleblower Montgomery's evidence to the public. He informs Sheriff Joe that Montgomery's data shows 154,000 peoples' private info from just the Sheriff's jurisdiction alone besides others was secretly taken by Clapper and Brennan. He also says private info on President Trump shows up \u201czillions\u201d of times in the spreadsheets Clapper and Brennan had Montgomery hack for them.  <a href=\"http://theamericanreport.org/2017/03/17/whistleblower-tapes-trump-wiretapped-zillion-times-hammer-brennans-clappers-secret-computer-system/\">http://theamericanreport.org/2017/03/17/whistleblower-tapes-trump-wiretapped-zillion-times-hammer-brennans-clappers-secret-computer-system/</a>    When Montgomery realized they set him up to \"hack all of America\" instead of terrorists, he took the hard drives etc. and left. google Klayman and Montgomery for more info. Oh, one other thing; these audio recordings and stuff were released by a judge involved with the hearing on Sheriff Joe's \"civil contempt\" and this judge used to be a FISA Court judge-the FISA Court being the one that approves or disapproves the Intel agencies requests to wiretap/surveill people.

Mr. Wray helped lead the Department\u2019s efforts to address the wave of corporate fraud scandals and restore integrity to U.S. financial markets.

In 2011, he was selected as one of a small number of national Client Service All-Stars based on BTI Consulting\u2019s independent surveys of corporate counsel.
